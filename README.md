## Description

  For companies, it is essential to keep track of their employees, roles, salaries, departments and even manager structure. Due to that reason I've created a reliable employee tracker application that serves the purpose. Using this application the user can create a database of employees, roles, salaries, departments and managers with simple clicks. This application is built using Node.js with the help of MySQL2, Inquirer and console.table npm packages.
